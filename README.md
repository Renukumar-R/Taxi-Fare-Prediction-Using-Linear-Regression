This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates how to predict taxi fares using linear regression. The project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can estimate the fare for a taxi ride based on various features such as distance traveled, number of passengers, and the time of day.

## Introduction

Taxi fare prediction is a crucial problem in the transportation industry, as accurate fare estimation is essential for both customers and service providers. This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model for taxi fares using linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` directory. The data is stored in the `taxi-fare-data.csv` file. The dataset contains various attributes, including:

- `pickup_datetime`: The timestamp of the taxi ride.
- `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`: Geographic coordinates of the pickup location.
- `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`: Geographic coordinates of the dropoff location.
- `passenger_count`: The number of passengers during the ride.
- `fare_amount`: The actual taxi fare we aim to predict.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Renukumar-R/Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Taxi-Fare-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
   ```

3. Install the required packages by running the command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook, `Taxi_Fare_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression.ipynb`, which provides a step-by-step implementation of the taxi fare prediction using linear regression. Execute each cell in the notebook to see the results and analysis.

## File Description

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data`: This directory contains the dataset file `taxi-fare-data.csv`.

- `Taxi_Fare_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of the linear regression model for taxi fare prediction.

- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages to run the project.

## How it Works

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values and irrelevant columns.

2. Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted from the dataset to assist in building the regression model.

3. Data Visualization: The data is visualized to gain insights and identify patterns.

4. Model Training: The linear regression model is trained using the processed data.

5. Fare Prediction: New data points are fed into the trained model to predict taxi fares.

## Results

The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results are discussed in the notebook.
